ABSTRACT
Management and maintain of customer relationship have always played a vital 
role to provide business intelligence to organizations to build, manage and 
develop valuable long term customer relationships. The importance of treating 
customers as an organizations main asset is increasing in value in present day 
and era. Organizations have an interest to invest in the development of customer 
acquisition, maintenance and development strategies. The business intelligence 
has a vital role to play in allowing companies to use technical expertise to gain 
better customer knowledge and Programs for outreach. Customer segmentation 
helps the marketing team to recognize and expose different customer segments 
that think differently and follow different purchasing strategies. Customer 
segmentation helps in figuring out the customers who vary in terms of 
preferences, expectations, desires and attributes. The main purpose of 
performing customer segmentation is to group people, who have similar interest 
so that the marketing team can converge in an effective marketing plan. 
Clustering is an iterative process of knowledge discovery from vast amounts of 
raw and unorganized data.
Customer segmentation is a separation of a market into multiple distinct groups 
of consumers who share the similar characteristics. Segmentation of market is 
an effective way to define and meet customer needs. Unsupervised Machine 
Learning Techniques, K-Means Clustering Algorithm, Minibatch K-Means and 
Hierarchical Clustering are used to perform Market Basket Analysis. Market 
Basket Analysis is carried out to predict the target customers who can be easily 
converged, among all the customers. In order to allow the marketing team to 
plan the strategy to market the new products to the target customers which are 
similar to their interests. Key words: Target Customers, Clusters, Unsupervised 
Learning, K-Means, Minibatch K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering 
Segmentation, Market Basket Analysis

Dataset Description
You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards, you have 
some basic data about your customers. Spending Score is something you assign 
to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and 
purchasing data.
Similarly in total data of 200 customer was collected to get more accurate and 
precise output and simultaneously train the model more accurately.

Algorithm: (K-mean Clustring)
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the 
clustering problems in machine learning or data science. In this topic, we will learn 
what is K-means clustering algorithm, how the algorithm works, along with the 
Python implementation of k-means clustering.

Conclusion
K means clustering is one of the most popular clustering algorithms and usually the first thing 
practitioners apply when solving clustering tasks to get an idea of the structure of the dataset. 
The goal of K means is to group data points into distinct non-overlapping subgroups. One of 
the major application of K means clustering is segmentation of customers to get a better 
understanding of them which in turn could be used to increase the revenue of the company
